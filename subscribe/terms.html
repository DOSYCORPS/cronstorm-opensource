        Simple terms for CronStorm
      </h1>
      <p>
        These terms are between you and CronStorm ("we", "us").
      <p>
        When you subscribe to the CronStorm API service to get a developer API key, you agree to these terms. If you cancel your subscription (which you can do at any time) we do not provide a refund for partial months, but instead your subscription (your API key) will remain operational until the end of that billing cycle. Billing cycles begin each month on the same date that you started your subscription, or the closest day to that.  
      <p>
        If you provided an email address when you paid (you may have had to do so, since Stripe (a payment provider we use, not affiliated with us) may require it), therefore you agree that you consent to us sending you some promotion mails about your subscription, reminders about subscription, overdue payments, and support emails about your service, or other notifications over email. If you wish to not receive these mails then you can email us at <a href=mailto:criscanbereached+dosy.help@gmail.com>this support address</a> to opt out and we will no longer contact you, except as we are required to do so by law or to resolve or clarify any issues about payment that, if we were not to contact you, would possibly have adverse legal consequences.
      <p>
        When you buy an interval you purchase a number of invocations. But actually that number is only the maximum number of invocations. The actualy invocations effected are always less than that because each request always takes slightly longer than the interval duration ( for example, a 1 seconds request typically takes 1.1 seconds ), so that means that over a 5 minute ( 300 invocation ) duration, you will typically only see about 270 invocations. This is normal. What you are in effect paying for is utilizing of our system for the specificied duration of time, which is always exact. But the number of invocations we provide at time of sale is only a guide and you agree to take it as such. If you have a need for a specific number of invocations ( rather than a specific exact duration over which they occur ) please contact us via email or raise an issue on our github issue tracker.
      <p>
        This is the beta release of pocketwatch. Currently limitations include (but not limited to): GET requests only,
        cannot delete an interval once it starts without knowing it's tracking number (long, secret code which you need to save
        if you want to prove you created the interval and want to request its deletion, currently request is via email). 
      <p>
        If you do request an interval deletion we do not currently offer any refunds. So please begin your intervals carefully. We can delete it for you if you request it (and have the tracking number) but you will not get any money back.
      <p>
        Use this tool at your own discretion. We are not responsible for how you use it. 
      <p>
        We reserve the right to delete intervals with no refund if it appears they are harmful in any way.
      <p>
        In general we will not offer refunds. But in case we do, they will be determined on a case by case basis.
      <p>
        Don't use the names The Dosaygo Corporation, DOSY, Dosycorp, or CronStorm.com in anyway that suggests partnership or endoresment or other relationship when none in fact exists.
      <p>
        This product is offered by the Dosyago Corporation, any legal action will be decided with respect to the laws of the United States, and through the courts in that jurisdiction.
      <p>
        Unless otherwise made explicit, no content or other corpyrightable or protected work may be reused or incorporated without prior written permission from us.
      <p>
        If you need to contact us open an issue at: https://github.com/dosyago-corp/service-issues/issues
      <p>
        We do our best to place and fulfill your orders as requested, and to achieve the specified rates of requests for the specified duration as ordered in your interval, however we do not guarantee we shall achieve this, and we are not responsible for issues related to external network latency, routing or other such issues, and in the case your interval suffers degraded performance on account of such or other issues we have limited control over, we certainly offer no refunds. This service does not currently have any SLA ( service level agreement ).
